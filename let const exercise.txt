What is hoisting?
--> Its the way how the javascript compiler works, for var keywords, the JS compiler 
would process those first by noting itself that they 'exist,' but doesn't look at 
the initialization value in the scope that these var keywords are declared in.
Variables used with var keywords are accessible and its values are undefined before
it is used later. Hoisting does not work with let and const keywords.
